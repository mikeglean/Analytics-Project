She then wishes to choose one Bellabeat product to which she will apply these insights in this presentation. \n\n**The following questions will guide the analysis:**\n\n* What are some trends in smart device usage?\n* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n**Report with the following deliverables:**\n\n* Report with the following deliverables:\n\nA clear summary of the business task\nA description of all data sources used\nDocumentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\nA summary of your analysis\nSupporting visualizations and key findings\nYour top high-level content recommendations based on your analysisA clear summary of the business task\n* A description of all data sources used\n* Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\n* A summary of your analysis\n* Supporting visualizations and key findings\n* Your top high-level content recommendations based on your analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"prepare\"></a>\n# <span style=\"color:#FF5733\"> 3. Prepare </span> \n\n> During the **Prepare phase**, we identify the data that will be used as well as its limitations. It is critical to understand how data is generated and collected, as well as to be able to identify and use various data types, formats, and structures in data analysis. More importantly, we must ensure that the data is unbiased and credible, as well as that it can be organized and protected.\n\n**[FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)** is being used for this analysis, and it contains personal fitness tracking from thirty Fitbit users. Information such as **daily activity, steps, calories, and sleeping habit**s are included. Data is stored on personal devices and is only used for trend analysis. Data is organized in a wide format.\n\n\n\n#### 3.1 Data Used <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"dataused\"></a> \nThis case study's data source is [**FitBit Fitness Tracker Data.**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and uploaded by Möbius.\n\n#### 3.2 Accessibility & Usage of Data <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"dataaccessibility\"></a>\nMöbius published the dataset to Kaggle.com under the CC0: Public Domain Creative Common License, which waives all rights to the work and allows the dataset to be copied, modified, distributed, and performed without permission. Furberg, Robert; Brinton, Julia; Keating, Michael; Ortiz, Alexa [[Source Here]](https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.YMoUpnVKiP9)\n\n#### 3.3 Data Summary <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"datasummary\"></a>\nThis dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between **03.12.2016 - 05.12.2016**. \n\n30 eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring, according to the dataset information submitted on Zenodo.org. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking.\n\n#### 3.4 Data Organization <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"dataorg\"></a>\n**18** datasets were downloaded from the **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data** in.csv file format, with long and wide formats. The datasets chosen for analysis below included a total of 33 participants over a 31-day period.\n\n\n#### 3.5 Data Limitations & Integrity <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"datalimit\"></a>\nBecause the **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data** was collected in 2016, the datasets are no longer relevant for current trend analysis. Furthermore, while the data initially states a time range of 03-12-2016 to 05-12-2016, data verification revealed that the data was collected only during a 31-day period (04-12-2016 to 05-12-2016). Because the data only covered a 31-day period, the timeframe for a more in-depth analysis is actually quite short.\n\n\n**Data ROCCC Analysis :**\n* **Reliable** : *YES*\n* **Original** : *YES*\n* **Comprehensive** : *YES*\n* **Current** : *NO (Based off historical data)*\n* **Cited** : *YES*\n\n***Overall, I believe the dataset adheres to the ROCCC guidelines and is sufficient and valid for analysis.***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"process\"></a>\n# <span style=\"color:#FF5733\"> 4. Process </span> \n\n> During this **process phase**, we create and transform data while maintaining its integrity. It is also where we test and validate data to determine which data fields need to be cleaned if necessary. Data cleaning documentation is also required to keep track of the changes made to the dataset.\n\nI used Excel to get a look at the data. The data was only collected for a 31-day period (04-12-2016 to 05-12-2016), so it was quite outdated because fitness trackers had matured significantly since then. The lack of demographic information (gender, location, and age) collected increases the data bias.\n\n#### 4.1 Datasets Cleaning and Verification<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"cleaning\"></a>\n\nI chose Spreadsheet to convert all of the date columns to \"Date (MM-DD-YYYY)\" format. I opened [Bigquery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery), then selected \"Create Project\" after converting some date-related data into \"Date\" format. In this case, I used ***Google*** to type in the name of the project I wanted to investigate. I named my new dataset ***Google Capstone*** for Bellabeat. I imported the.csv datasets I previously downloaded from [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) inside Google Capstone dataset (Note: Don't forget to unzip the file). Only raw data with Daily information was uploaded.\n\nHere is the initial summary of the data cleaning using spreadsheet:\n\n![Data Cleaning- Excel Summary](https://i.imgur.com/wjZFqAT.png)\n\nAfter that, I started my work by finding the total number of users' id for each file.

The app will intermittently remind users to complete tasks on an hourly basis. Furthermore, if we're marketing the app as a \"companion,\" the app should \"grow\" with us so that it feels personalized and as if someone is growing alongside you.\n* Implement a weight-loss function that focuses solely on **calorie burning**. It should be done in accordance with the preceding recommendation, with steps and physical intensity serving as primary predictors of calorie burn.\n* Due to the limitations of the provided data, conduct another study handled by us rather than a third party and recruit current Bellabeat users as participants. This allows us to access various functions, such as the weight-loss function mentioned above.\n* I'd advise Bellabeat to market their products to customers who are likely to have this type of routine — customers with a set job schedule and parents with a set daily routine.","metadata":{}}]}
